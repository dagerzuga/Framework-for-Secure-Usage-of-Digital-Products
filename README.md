## ❌ What this is not
It's important to clarify the scope and intentions of this project:

- **Not an Anonymity Guide**: This is not a guide on how to become completely anonymous on the internet. While it discusses privacy measures, the focus is on practical, everyday security rather than extreme anonymity.

- **Not About Being a "Ghost"**: The goal is not to help users disappear from the internet entirely. Instead, it aims to help engage with digital technologies in a secure and privacy-conscious manner.

- **Not for Illegal Activities**: This guide is intended for lawful use only. It does not provide information or assistance for any illegal activities.

- **Not a Substitute for Professional Advice**: While striving to provide accurate and up-to-date information, this guide should not be considered a substitute for professional security audits or legal advice.

The aim is to provide a balanced approach to digital security and privacy, suitable for everyday users who want to protect themselves online without completely withdrawing from the digital world.

# 🚀 Before we start

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Digital Footprint

Your digital footprint is the trail of data you create while using the Internet. It includes websites you visit, emails you send, and information you submit online. Understanding your digital footprint is crucial for managing your online privacy.

### 2. Encryption

Encryption is the process of encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it. It's a fundamental concept in digital security, used to protect data in transit and at rest.

### 3. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

E2EE ensures that only the communicating users can read the messages. No eavesdropper – including the service provider – can access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation.

### 4. Open Source Software

Open source software has its source code freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. It often undergoes community scrutiny, which can lead to better security and privacy features.

### 5. Data Minimization

Data minimization is the practice of limiting the amount of data you share online to only what is necessary. It's a key principle in protecting your privacy.

### 6. Metadata

Metadata is data that provides information about other data. In the context of digital privacy, metadata can reveal a lot about your communications and online activities, even if the content itself is encrypted.

### 7. Security vs. Privacy

While often used interchangeably, security and privacy are distinct concepts:
- Security refers to the protection of your data and systems from unauthorized access or attacks.
- Privacy relates to the control you have over your personal information and how it's collected, used, and shared.

A system can be secure without being private (e.g., a social media platform with strong security measures but that collects and sells user data).

### 8. Self-Hosting

Self-hosting refers to the practice of locally running and maintaining a website or service on your own server or computer, rather than using a third-party service. It gives you more control over your data and privacy, but requires technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance.

## 🔑 Identity and Account Management

### 🔐 Passwords and Passphrases

Passwords and passphrases are your first line of defense in protecting your online accounts. Understanding the difference between them and how to use them effectively is crucial for maintaining your online security.

#### 🔍 Password vs Passphrase

- **Password**: Typically a shorter string of characters, often including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. For example: `o9uadn#$as5-d!`.

- **Passphrase**: A longer sequence of words or a sentence that's easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess. For example: `Isuper-Love-TAC0S400%MORE`.

Passphrases are generally more secure and easier to remember than traditional passwords.

#### 🛡️ Best Practices for Password and Passphrase Usage

1. **Use a Password Manager**: A password manager is a secure, encrypted digital vault for all your passwords. It allows you to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts without having to memorize them.

2. **Create a Strong Master Passphrase**: For your password manager, create one very strong, memorable passphrase. This is the only one you'll need to remember. Make it long and unique to you.

3. **Generate Strong Passwords**: Use your password manager to generate strong, random passwords for all your individual accounts. These can be long and complex since you won't need to memorize them.

4. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Whenever possible, enable 2FA on your accounts for an extra layer of security.

5. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and update your passwords, especially for important accounts.

#### 🔑 Key Considerations for a password manager

##### Must Have:
- **Strong Encryption**: The password manager should use robust encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) to protect your data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: The service provider should have no way to access your master password or decrypt your data.
- **Open-Source**: Allows for community review of the code, increasing transparency and trust.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: The ability to add an extra layer of security to your password manager account.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Access your passwords across all your devices and operating systems.
- **Secure Password Sharing**: Ability to safely share passwords with trusted contacts or team members.
- **Automatic Syncing**: Your passwords should automatically sync across all your devices.
- **Secure Password Generation**: Built-in tool to create strong, random passwords.
- **Auto-Fill Capability**: Easily fill in login forms on websites and apps. 

##### Nice to Have:
- **Breach Monitoring**: Alerts when your accounts may have been compromised in known data breaches.
