# 🌟 Introduction

## ✅ What this is
This project is a comprehensive guide designed to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the digital world securely and privately.
Key aspects of this project include:

- **Practical Workflows**: This document provides detailed, step-by-step guides for common digital scenarios, focusing on the most secure and private approaches. These workflows cover a wide range of activities, from sharing pictures with family to creating online accounts without compromising personal information.

- **Security Best Practices**: The project offers a wide range of security guidelines, covering everything from safe browsing habits to secure device management, helping users build a strong foundation for their digital security.

- **Privacy Protection**: This guide delves into privacy concerns in the digital age and provides actionable advice on how to safeguard personal information across various platforms and services.

- **Product Recommendations**: The project includes carefully curated lists of recommended digital products and services, such as VPNs, secure email providers, and messaging apps. It also highlights products and services to avoid, explaining the potential risks associated with them.

## ❌ What this is not
It's important to clarify the scope and intentions of this project:

- **Not an Anonymity Guide**: This is not a guide on how to become completely anonymous on the internet. While it discusses privacy measures, the focus is on practical, everyday security rather than extreme anonymity.

- **Not About Being a "Ghost"**: The goal is not to help users disappear from the internet entirely. Instead, it aims to help engage with digital technologies in a secure and privacy-conscious manner.

- **Not for Illegal Activities**: This guide is intended for lawful use only. It does not provide information or assistance for any illegal activities.

- **Not a Substitute for Professional Advice**: While striving to provide accurate and up-to-date information, this guide should not be considered a substitute for professional security audits or legal advice.

The aim is to provide a balanced approach to digital security and privacy, suitable for everyday users who want to protect themselves online without completely withdrawing from the digital world.

# 🚀 Before we start

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Digital Footprint

Your digital footprint is the trail of data you create while using the Internet. It includes websites you visit, emails you send, and information you submit online. Understanding your digital footprint is crucial for managing your online privacy.

### 2. Encryption

Encryption is the process of encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it. It's a fundamental concept in digital security, used to protect data in transit and at rest.

### 3. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

E2EE ensures that only the communicating users can read the messages. No eavesdropper – including the service provider – can access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation.

### 4. Open Source Software

Open source software has its source code freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. It often undergoes community scrutiny, which can lead to better security and privacy features.

### 5. Data Minimization

Data minimization is the practice of limiting the amount of data you share online to only what is necessary. It's a key principle in protecting your privacy.

### 6. Metadata

Metadata is data that provides information about other data. In the context of digital privacy, metadata can reveal a lot about your communications and online activities, even if the content itself is encrypted.

### 7. Security vs. Privacy

While often used interchangeably, security and privacy are distinct concepts:
- Security refers to the protection of your data and systems from unauthorized access or attacks.
- Privacy relates to the control you have over your personal information and how it's collected, used, and shared.

A system can be secure without being private (e.g., a social media platform with strong security measures but that collects and sells user data).

### 8. Self-Hosting

Self-hosting refers to the practice of locally running and maintaining a website or service on your own server or computer, rather than using a third-party service. It gives you more control over your data and privacy, but requires technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance.
