# 🚀 Before we start

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Digital Footprint

Your digital footprint is the trail of data you create while using the Internet. It includes websites you visit, emails you send, and information you submit online. Understanding your digital footprint is crucial for managing your online privacy.

### 2. Encryption

Encryption is the process of encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it. It's a fundamental concept in digital security, used to protect data in transit and at rest.

### 3. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

E2EE ensures that only the communicating users can read the messages. No eavesdropper – including the service provider – can access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation.

### 4. Open Source Software

Open source software has its source code freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. It often undergoes community scrutiny, which can lead to better security and privacy features.

### 5. Data Minimization

Data minimization is the practice of limiting the amount of data you share online to only what is necessary. It's a key principle in protecting your privacy.

### 6. Metadata

Metadata is data that provides information about other data. In the context of digital privacy, metadata can reveal a lot about your communications and online activities, even if the content itself is encrypted.

### 7. Security vs. Privacy

While often used interchangeably, security and privacy are distinct concepts:
- Security refers to the protection of your data and systems from unauthorized access or attacks.
- Privacy relates to the control you have over your personal information and how it's collected, used, and shared.

A system can be secure without being private (e.g., a social media platform with strong security measures but that collects and sells user data).

### 8. Self-Hosting

Self-hosting refers to the practice of locally running and maintaining a website or service on your own server or computer, rather than using a third-party service. It gives you more control over your data and privacy, but requires technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance.

## 🔑 Identity and Account Management

### 🔐 Passwords and Passphrases

Passwords and passphrases are your first line of defense in protecting your online accounts. Understanding the difference between them and how to use them effectively is crucial for maintaining your online security.

#### 🔍 Password vs Passphrase

- **Password**: Typically a shorter string of characters, often including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. For example: `o9uadn#$as5-d!`.

- **Passphrase**: A longer sequence of words or a sentence that's easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess. For example: `Isuper-Love-TAC0S400%MORE`.

Passphrases are generally more secure and easier to remember than traditional passwords.

#### 🛡️ Best Practices for Password and Passphrase Usage

1. **Use a Password Manager**: A password manager is a secure, encrypted digital vault for all your passwords. It allows you to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts without having to memorize them.

2. **Create a Strong Master Passphrase**: For your password manager, create one very strong, memorable passphrase. This is the only one you'll need to remember. Make it long and unique to you.

3. **Generate Strong Passwords**: Use your password manager to generate strong, random passwords for all your individual accounts. These can be long and complex since you won't need to memorize them.

4. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Whenever possible, enable 2FA on your accounts for an extra layer of security.

5. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and update your passwords, especially for important accounts.

#### 🔑 Key Considerations for a password manager

##### Must Have:
- **Strong Encryption**: The password manager should use robust encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) to protect your data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: The service provider should have no way to access your master password or decrypt your data.
- **Open-Source**: Allows for community review of the code, increasing transparency and trust.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: The ability to add an extra layer of security to your password manager account.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Access your passwords across all your devices and operating systems.
- **Secure Password Sharing**: Ability to safely share passwords with trusted contacts or team members.
- **Automatic Syncing**: Your passwords should automatically sync across all your devices.
- **Secure Password Generation**: Built-in tool to create strong, random passwords.
- **Auto-Fill Capability**: Easily fill in login forms on websites and apps. 

##### Nice to Have:

### 🔢 Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

#### 🔍 Understanding MFA, 2FA, and Related Concepts

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: A security system that requires two or more forms of authentication to verify a user's identity.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: A subset of MFA that specifically requires two different forms of authentication.

- **One-Time Password (OTP)**: A automatically generated password that is valid for only one login session or transaction. It's commonly used as a second factor in 2FA.

- **Factors of Authentication**: These typically fall into three categories:
  1. Something you know (e.g., password, PIN)
  2. Something you have (e.g., smartphone, security key)
  3. Something you are (e.g., fingerprint, face scan)

#### 🛡️ Best Practices for MFA Usage

1. **Enable MFA Everywhere Possible**: Activate MFA on all accounts that offer it, especially for critical services like email, banking, and social media.

2. **Use Strong Second Factors**: Prefer more secure methods like hardware security keys or authenticator apps over SMS-based authentication. We'll see what methos are more secure than others later in this section.

3. **Backup Your Second Factor**: Always set up backup methods or recovery codes in case you lose access to your primary second factor.

4. **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure your authenticator apps and devices are always up-to-date to benefit from the latest security improvements.

5. **Be Wary of Phishing**: Remember that MFA doesn't make you immune to phishing attacks. Always verify the authenticity of websites requesting your MFA codes.

#### 🔑 Recommended MFA Methods (from most to least secure)

1. **Hardware Security Keys**: Physical devices that generate one-time codes or use protocols like FIDO2.
   - Example: YubiKey (more of this later in this section)

2. **Authenticator Apps**: Software that generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
   - Examples: Ente Auth, Aegis Authenticator (more of this later in this section)

3. **Push Notifications**: Notifications sent to a trusted device for approval.
   - Example: If you try to log in to YouTube from a new location, you will get a notification to approve it on a device associated with that account.

5. **Email**: One-time codes sent to a email address.

#### ❌ MFA Methods to Avoid

1. **SMS-based Authentication**: Vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks and interception.

2. **Recovery Questions**: Often based on information that could be easily guessed or found through social engineering.

#### 🔑 Key Considerations for OTP Apps

##### Must Have:
- **Secure Backup and Recovery**: The app should offer a secure way to backup your OTP seeds, allowing you to recover access if you lose your device.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Any backup or sync feature should use strong, end-to-end encryption to protect your OTP seeds.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: The app should work across multiple devices and operating systems for convenience and accessibility.
- **Open Source**: Open-source apps allow for community review of the code, increasing transparency and trust.
- **Multiple Device Sync**: Secure synchronization across multiple devices for convenience.

##### Nice to Have:
- **Encrypted Export Option**: The ability to export your OTP seeds in an encrypted format for manual backups.

#### ✅ Recommended Products

1. **[Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth)**
   - Open-source authenticator app
   - End-to-end encrypted backups and sync
   - Cross-platform support
   - Privacy-focused (same company behind ente photos)

3. **[YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/)**
   - Hardware security key
   - Supports multiple authentication protocols
   - Highly secure and phishing-resistant
   - No batteries or network connectivity required

#### ⚠️ Products that could work

1. **[Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass)**
   - Great app to use as password manager (see `Passwords and Passphrases` section) from Proton, a company with privacy-first products. However, you shouldn't use this for your OTPs if you use this as your password manager.

2. **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)**
   - Great app to use as password manager (see `Passwords and Passphrases` section). However, you shouldn't use this for your OTPs if you use this as your password manager.
  
4. **[Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/)**
   - Android only
   - Open-source
   - Encrypted backups

#### ❌ Products to Avoid

1. **[Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)**
   - Privacy concerns due to Google's data collection practices

2. **[Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app)**
   - Tied to Microsoft account
   - Potential privacy issues due to Microsoft's data practices

#### 🔑 Key Consideration: Separating Password Manager and Authenticator

Ideally, it's recommended to use separate apps for password management and one-time passwords (OTP) for several reasons:

1. **Security Isolation**: If one app is compromised, the attacker doesn't gain access to both your passwords and OTP codes.

2. **Reduced Single Point of Failure**: Using separate apps ensures that if you lose access to one (e.g., forgotten master password), you don't lose access to both your passwords and 2FA codes.

3. **Specialization**: Dedicated authenticator apps often offer features specifically designed for MFA, such as secure backups and easier account migration.

### 📧 Email Security

Your email is central to almost everything you do online. It's how you sign up for services, recover accounts, and communicate. That's why it's crucial to keep it secure.

> Consider this: You use your primary email for job searching, online shopping, and social media. A data broker obtains this email through a breach. They can now link your professional background from job sites, your purchasing habits from e-commerce emails, and your social connections from social media. This comprehensive profile could be used for targeted advertising, sold to potential employers, or even used to manipulate your opinions through personalized content.

#### 🛡️ Best Practices for Email Usage

1. **Use Email Aliases**: Create unique aliases for different purposes:
   - One alias per online service when possible (e.g., separate aliases for GitHub, CodePen, LinkedIn)
   - When not possible, group aliases by category:
     - Social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
     - Financial and educational institutions
     - Developer accounts (GitHub, CodePen, AWS)

2. **Protect Your Identity**:
   - Use your real name or last name only for emails related to bank, education or work
   - For other purposes, avoid including your name or any other piece of real information in the email address. Use something generic.

3. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review your email settings, connected apps, and active sessions.

4. **Be Cautious with Attachments**: Never open attachments from unknown senders, and be wary of unexpected attachments even from known contacts.

5. **Use Secure Communication**: For sensitive information, consider using encrypted messaging apps instead of email. Remember that, by nature, email is not a secure communication channel.

#### 📩 Understanding Email Aliases

An email alias is an alternative email address that forwards incoming messages to your main email account. It's like having multiple mailboxes that all route mail to a single destination. Here's why email aliases are important for security and privacy:

1. **Compartmentalization**: Use different aliases for different services to prevent correlation of your online activities.
2. **Spam Control**: If an alias starts receiving spam, you can easily disable or delete it without affecting your main email.
3. **Privacy Protection**: Aliases allow you to interact online without revealing your primary email address.
4. **Easy Organization**: You can sort incoming emails based on which alias they were sent to.

#### 🔑 Key Considerations for email providers

##### Must Have:
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Choose an email provider that offers E2EE to ensure that only you and your intended recipient can read the contents of your emails.
- **Strong Authentication**: Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your email accounts.

- Sign up for SimpleLogin using your proton account (it's owned by the same company)
- Enable 2FA for your SimpleLogin account as well

4) Create Aliases for Various Services:

- For each new account you create online, generate a new alias in SimpleLogin
- Use a naming convention that includes the service name, e.g., codepen-3xj2k@simplelogin.io
- Ensure these aliases are completely different from your main Proton email. These are some examples:
   - twitter-y7lpq@simplelogin.io
   - amazon-9fmr3@simplelogin.io
   - reddit-h2ns8@simplelogin.io

5) Set Up Additional Proton Addresses (for paid plans):

- Create a more formal email for professional use: firstname.lastname@proton.me
Use this for:

   - Banking communications
   - Government services
   - Job applications
   - University correspondence

Consider creating separate addresses for different areas of your life, e.g.:

- firstname-number-lastname@proton.me for financial matters
- lastname.number.firstname@proton.me for educational purposes

> Remember to use a password manager to genearte one unique password per account

### 👤 Online Account Creation and Deletion

When creating and managing online accounts, it's crucial to be mindful of the information you provide. Here are some best practices to protect your privacy and security:

#### Account Creation Best Practices:

- **Username Selection**: Avoid using your real name in usernames, unless it's for professional platforms like LinkedIn or GitHub where you want to be identifiable. Create unique usernames for different platforms to prevent cross-platform tracking.

- **Profile Pictures**: Don't upload real pictures of yourself, except for professional or social networking sites where it's necessary. Consider using illustrations or pictures of objects instead (leaving it blank is even better).

- **Personal Information**: Provide only the minimum required information when signing up. For non-essential fields (e.g., Spotify asking for your real name or location), use fictitious information. Don't provide your real age or gender unless absolutely necessary.

- **Birthdate**: If a birthdate is required, consider using a fake one. Just remember it for account recovery purposes. If the year is required, choose one that makes you over 18 to avoid youth restrictions.

- **Location**: Unless the service is location-specific (like food delivery), provide a general area rather than your exact location. If you don't need anything location-related from the account in question, just put something generic like USA, China, or India (countries with large populations).

- **Security Questions**: Treat security questions as additional passwords. Don't provide real answers that someone could guess or find out. Use a random password to fill out these fields and store them in your password manager.

- **Social Media Connections**: Never use the option to "Sign in with Facebook/Gmail/Any other account" when possible. Create separate accounts instead.

- **Email Usage**: Use email aliases for each account as discussed in the previous section.

- **Password Creation**: Use a unique, strong password for each account. Consider using a password manager.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA whenever possible, preferably using an authenticator app rather than SMS.


#### Account Deletion Best Practices:

- Regularly audit your online presence and delete accounts of products you don't use anymore.
- If an app doesn't allow you to delete your account, change all your information to dummy data, and then delete the email alias you used for that account.
- Before deleting an account, make sure it's not linked to other services you use.
- Look for "Delete Account" options rather than just "Deactivate."
- After requesting account deletion, follow up to ensure it's been processed. Check if you stop receiving emails or if you can no longer log in.
- Be aware of "zombie" accounts - some services might retain your data even after deletion. Consider this when signing up for new services.

### 🤖 AI 

As AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) become more prevalent in our daily lives, it's crucial to use these tools responsibly and with privacy in mind. Here are some best practices and considerations:

#### ✅ Best Practices for AI Interaction:

- **Anonymize Your Data**: Before uploading any document or information to an AI service, remove all personal identifiable information (PII). For example, if seeking medical advice, only include relevant symptoms and medical history, not your name, address, or full medical records.

- **Segment Your Information**: Instead of uploading entire documents, extract only the relevant parts you want to analyze. This minimizes the amount of data you're sharing.

- **Use Anonymous Services**: Consider using AI chat services that prioritize privacy. For example, DuckDuckGo offers an option to use LLMs anonymously: [DuckDuckGo AI Chat](https://duckduckgo.com/chat)

- **Account Creation**: When signing up for AI services, follow the best practices outlined in the [👤 Online Account Creation and Deletion](#-online-account-creation-and-deletion) section of this document. Use email aliases, avoid providing real personal information, and use strong, unique passwords.

- **Avoid Sensitive Topics**: Be cautious about discussing highly personal or sensitive topics with AI. Remember, your conversations may be used to train the AI further.

#### 🚫 Things to Avoid:

- **Don't Share Personal Documents**: Never upload entire personal documents like medical records, financial statements, or legal documents to AI services.

- **Avoid Real Names**: Don't use real names (yours or others) when interacting with AI. Use pseudonyms or generic terms like "my friend" or "my colleague".

- **No Financial Information**: Never share credit card numbers, bank account details, or other financial information with AI services.

- **Don't share Credentials**: Never put credentials such as passwords, 2FA codes, API keys or anything that has to do with authentication.

#### ⚠️ General Considerations:

- **Data Retention**: Be aware that many AI services retain conversation logs. Treat every interaction as potentially permanent.

- **AI Limitations**: Remember that AI, while powerful, can make mistakes or provide outdated information. Always verify critical information from authoritative sources.

- **Terms of Service**: Always read the terms of service and privacy policy of AI services to understand how your data will be used and stored.
